# Container Creation and Performance Testing with Docker

## Goal
The goal is to set up and manage a multi-container application using Docker and Docker.

## Prerequisites
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2).

## Docker Installation
Before starting, let's make sure that the version of the subsystem in the machine is WSL 2 (necessary to run Docker). You can run in your Windows PowerShell the following command
```
wsl -l -v
```
which should output your WSL version and distribution.
```
  NAME      STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu    Running         2
```
