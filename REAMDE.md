# Cluster Creation with VMs (VirtualBox) / Containers (Docker) and Performance Testing

This repository encapsulates two similar approaches to the same problem: simulating a cluster of machines.

- [Cluster Creation and Performance Testing in VirtualBox](cluster-creation-and-performance-testing-in-virtualBox.md) explains how to create and set up a cluster of virtual machines from scracth using VirtualBox, as well as how to test its performance with different benchmarks.

- [Container Creation and Performance Testing with Docker](container-creation-and-performance-testing-with-docker.md) explains how to create and set up a set of containers using Docker, exploring from the images creation with dockerfiles to the definition and management of multi-container Docker applications with docker compose.
